# qaoa-timetabling
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) applied to the University Timetabling Problem (UTP). This project formulates exam scheduling as a Graph Colouring Problem, encodes it into a QUBO model, and solves it using QAOA via Qiskit. Includes performance analysis across varying penalty constants for optimization.
